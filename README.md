# Loan-Approval-Predictions
It is a Project of Data Science where I am using ML to build a model which predicts whether loan will get approved or not.

You can download my model and directly check your status.

To predict your status you have to enter below listed details in numeric
1. Gender: for male 1 and for female 0
2. Married: 0 for NO and 1 for YES
3. Dependents: How many dependants you have (in numeric form)
4. Education: For Graduate enter 0 else enter 1
5. Self_Employed: 0 for No and 1 for yes
6. ApplicantIncome: your income in numeric form
7. CoapplicantIncome: in numeric form
8. LoanAmount (in thousand): in numeric form
9. Loan_Amount_Term(Term of loan in months): in numeric form
10. Credit_History: in numeric form
11. Property_Area (Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural): 0 for Rural, 1 for Semi Urban and 2 for Urban area

You can see the result predicted by my model.
